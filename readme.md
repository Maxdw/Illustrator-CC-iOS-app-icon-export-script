Illustrator CC iOS app icon export script
======================
This script will export your active artboard to all retina and non-retina app icon sizes in .png format. The sizes are obtained from a hard-coded JSON/Javascript array that originates from XCode's Contents.json that is generated when creating a Appicon asset in XCode.
